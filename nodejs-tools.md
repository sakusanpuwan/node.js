## .env
`npm install dotenv --save` - Installs the dotenv package and saves it as a dependency in the package.json file.

`dotenv` - A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. It is used to manage configuration settings and sensitive information in Node.js applications.

```
// .env
SECRET_KEY = "qwerty"
```

```js
import 'dotenv/config';

console.log(`Environment variable: ${process.env.SECRET_KEY}`);
```

**NOTE** - The .env file should not be committed to version control (e.g., Git) as it may contain sensitive information. It is recommended to add the .env file to the `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked by Git. 

## nodemon
`npm install nodemon --save-dev` - Installs the nodemon package as a development dependency in the package.json file.

`nodemon` - A utility that monitors changes in the source code and automatically restarts the Node.js application when changes are detected. It is useful for development purposes to avoid manually restarting the server after every change.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js", // Starts the application using Node.js
    "start:dev": "nodemon index.js" // Starts the application in development mode using nodemon
  }
}
```

## Jest
`npm install jest` - Installs the Jest testing framework as a dependency in the package.json file.

`jest` - A JavaScript testing framework that allows developers to write and run tests for their code. It provides features such as test runners, assertions, and mocking.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest", // Runs all tests in the project
    "test:watch": "jest --watch", // Runs tests in watch mode, re-running tests when files change
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage", // Generates test coverage reports
    "test:verbose": "jest --verbose" // Runs tests with detailed output 
  }
}
```

`npm install babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env` - Installs Babel and its preset for transforming modern JavaScript code into a version compatible with older environments.
`babel-jest` - A Jest transformer that allows Jest to process JavaScript files using Babel.

`@babel/core` - The core library of Babel, which is responsible for transforming JavaScript code.

`@babel/preset-env` - A preset that allows you to use the latest JavaScript features by automatically determining the Babel plugins and polyfills needed based on your target environment.

```
// .babelrc
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

`npm run test:coverage` - Runs Jest with coverage reporting enabled, generating a coverage report for the tests. 

`./coverage/lcov-report/index.html` - The coverage report generated by Jest, which can be opened in a web browser to view detailed coverage information.
